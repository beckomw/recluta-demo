Below is the prompt that convinced me to pivot. 

- The Core Problem You Should Solve
People don't need to apply to MORE jobs. They need to know WHICH jobs they can actually win.
The painful truth: 95% of applications are wasted effort. Most job seekers apply to roles they're not competitive for and never hear back. That's the real problem.
- The Pivot: "Application Readiness Platform"
- New tagline: "Know if you're competitive before you apply"

- What To Keep (The Good Stuff)
- Story #8: Skills Gap Analysis ← This is your gold
This is actually differentiated if you execute it right. Expand this into the core feature.
- Story #5: Job Posting Capture ← Essential input
But pivot focus: instead of "capture to spam," it's "capture to analyze if I should even apply"
- Story #2: Master Resume Management ← Necessary foundation
But simplified - just structured data entry, skip the complex parsing initially

## 💾 Data Storage

All data is stored in your browser's localStorage:

- **Key**: `app_jobs` - Stores all job postings

**Important Notes:**
- Data persists across browser sessions
- Data is local to your browser (not synced across devices)
- Clearing browser data will delete your saved information
- No backend required - works completely offline

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Pure Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks, no build process
- **Class-based Structure**: Organized into manager classes
- **Event-driven**: Responsive to user interactions
- **Modular**: Separated concerns (resume, jobs, comparison)

### Key Algorithms

**Skills Extraction:**
```javascript
// Splits text by commas, newlines, or semicolons
// Removes duplicates and trims whitespace
Utils.extractSkills(text)
```

**Skills Matching:**
```javascript
// Performs fuzzy matching:
// 1. Exact match (case-insensitive)
// 2. Partial match (one contains the other)
// Example: "React" matches "React.js"
analyzeMatch(resume, job)
```

**Match Calculation:**
```javascript
matchPercentage = (matchingSkills / totalRequirements) × 100
```
