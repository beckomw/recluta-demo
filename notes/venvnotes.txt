âœ¦ Of course. Here are the basic commands for managing a Python virtual environment.

  1. Create the virtual environment
  This command creates a new directory named venv in your project folder containing the 
  Python interpreter and libraries.

   1 python3 -m venv venv

  2. Activate the virtual environment
  Activation modifies your shell's prompt to indicate which environment you're in and 
  configures your PATH.

   * Linux/macOS:
   1     source venv/bin/activate
   * Windows (Command Prompt):
   1     venv\Scripts\activate.bat
   * Windows (PowerShell):
   1     venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

  3. Deactivate the virtual environment
  When you're done, this command returns you to your system's default Python environment.

   1 deactivate
